## 🎯 Your GHC Elevator Pitch

### **30-Second Version**
> *"Hi, I'm Swathi, a Data Engineer who transforms complex business problems into actionable insights. I recently analyzed 128K+ Amazon sales records and identified $3.2M+ in revenue recovery opportunities by pinpointing geographic bottlenecks causing 18.67% delivery failures. Using advanced SQL, DuckDB, and Tableau, I helped optimize fulfillment channels and reduce operational risks. I'm excited to connect with companies that value data-driven decision making. What kind of data challenges is your team currently facing?"*

### **60-Second Extended Version**
> *"Hi, I'm Swathi Bhaskaran, a Data Engineer specializing in business intelligence and analytics. I have a unique combination of technical skills in SQL, Python, DuckDB, and Tableau, combined with strong business acumen. My most recent project involved analyzing 128K+ Amazon sales records to identify critical logistics failures that were directly impacting profitability. Through advanced SQL analysis and interactive Tableau dashboards, I discovered that 72% of revenue was dependent on an unreliable fulfillment channel with an 11.46% failure rate, compared to just 2.50% for Amazon FBA. I pinpointed geographic bottlenecks in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, and provided actionable recommendations that could recover $3.2M+ in revenue. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can use data to drive strategic business decisions and create measurable impact. I'd love to learn more about your team's data initiatives and how I might contribute to your analytics goals."*
