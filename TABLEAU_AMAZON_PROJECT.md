# ðŸ“¦ Amazon Sales Analysis: Interactive Tableau Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of an Amazon Seller's sales data to identify and resolve critical, hidden logistics failures that were directly impacting profitability and customer satisfaction. The core goal was to pinpoint where and why a high-volume fulfillment channel was underperforming compared to the industry standard.

**Metric: Channel Dependence (The Business Asset)**  
72% of revenue came from the 'Merchant' (seller-fulfilled) channel.

**Reliability (The Business Risk)**  
The 'Merchant' channel had an 11.46% delivery failure rate.

**Problem Source (The Root Cause)**  
The failure rate was concentrated geographically in two key states.

- **Tableau Desktop**: Advanced data visualization and dashboard creation for interactive analysis
- **Data Source**: Amazon Sales Report CSV (128K+ records) with geographic and channel data
- **Visualization Types**: Bar charts, geographic maps, scatter plots, and interactive dashboards
- **Interactive Features**: Filters, tooltips, cross-chart interactions, and real-time filtering

## ðŸ”‘ Key Analytical Insights

The analysis proceeded through a four-phase structure to diagnose the problem:

### **1. Fulfillment Quality Risk (The "What")**
**Finding**: The 'Merchant' fulfillment channel, which drives 72% of total revenue, was found to be highly unreliable with an 11.46% delivery failure rate (Undelivered, RTO, Lost).  
**Benchmark**: This compares poorly to the high-standard 2.50% failure rate of the 'Amazon' (FBA) channel.

### **2. Geographic Pinpointing (The "Where")**
**Finding**: The average 11.46% failure rate was not uniform; it was primarily caused by severe bottlenecks in two states.  
**Evidence**: The failure rate for the 'Merchant' channel was 18.67% in West Bengal and 17.14% in Tamil Nadu.

### **3. Product Exposure (The "Who")**
**Finding**: By applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule), the analysis showed the high-risk states were driven by sales of the most valuable products.  
**Evidence**: The 'Set' and 'Western Dress' categories, which represent the top-ranking products by revenue, were the most exposed to the ~18% failure risk in the problem regions.

## ðŸš€ Actionable Recommendation

Based on the evidence, the following strategy was provided to the client for immediate profit recovery:

1. **Logistics Re-routing**: Immediately shift inventory of the highest-revenue categories (Set and Western Dress) from the low-reliability 'Merchant' channel to the reliable 'Amazon' (FBA) channel, specifically for orders shipping to West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.

2. **Courier Audit**: Use the 18.67% failure rate as leverage to renegotiate or replace the local courier partner for the 'Merchant' channel in the identified problem states.

This targeted action minimizes risk for the most valuable products and directly addresses the largest source of logistical inefficiency.
